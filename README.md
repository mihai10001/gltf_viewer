# gltf_viewer
Simple glTF Viewer [ Three.JS, Flask ]

-Made as a Computer Graphics project
-Using WebGL and JS, I created an accesible web application, containing
a canvas made for viewing and interacting with your glTF based objects


# How to use:
## Method 1:
I hosted the app on a cloud server, for easy access with the link below:
** https://gltf-viewer.herokuapp.com/ **
When first accesing the link, please leave Heroku a 1/2 minute delay to 
start the container with the app

##Method 2:
Run the web server with the following command, from inside the app directory:
** python3 main.py **
Acess the server locally with the link:
** localhost:5000 **


# Dependencies:
Flask - Web server
( Linux install : pip3 install --user flask )
